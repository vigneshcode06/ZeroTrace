## 👾 What is ZeroTrace?  
ZeroTrace is a **fun and stealthy remote prank tool** that lets you control a **Windows laptop remotely** via a Termux-based attacker script. You can execute **hilarious and chaotic commands** like:  
✅ **Playing fullscreen videos at max volume** 🔊🎬  
✅ **Opening 50 separate CMD windows with a hacking-style effect** 💀💻  
✅ **Triggering a Notepad spam attack (LOL Mode)** 🤣📄  
✅ **Remotely shutting down the target PC** 🛑💣  
✅ **And more…**  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Remote CMD Execution** – Send commands remotely from Termux.  
- **Fully Stealthy** – Runs in the background without user knowledge.  
- **Custom Hacker-Themed Effects** – Looks super realistic and terrifying!  
- **Instant Execution** – Commands execute in real-time.  
- **Expandable** – You can add your own prank commands!

## 📜 How It Works
ZeroTrace has two parts:  
1️⃣ **Attacker Script (Termux/Linux)** – Sends prank commands to the target.  
2️⃣ **Victim Script (Windows)** – Listens for commands and executes them.  

When the attacker sends a command, the victim’s laptop **immediately obeys**, creating chaos. 😈
