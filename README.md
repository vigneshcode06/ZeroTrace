👾 What is ZeroTrace?
ZeroTrace is a fun and stealthy remote prank tool that lets you control a Windows laptop remotely via a Termux-based attacker script. You can execute hilarious and chaotic commands like:
✅ Playing fullscreen videos at max volume 🔊🎬
✅ Opening 50 separate CMD windows with a hacking-style effect 💀💻
✅ Triggering a Notepad spam attack (LOL Mode) 🤣📄
✅ Remotely shutting down the target PC 🛑💣
✅ And more…

🚀 Features
🔹 Remote CMD Execution – Send commands remotely from Termux.
🔹 Fully Stealthy – Runs in the background without user knowledge.
🔹 Custom Hacker-Themed Effects – Looks super realistic and terrifying!
🔹 Instant Execution – Commands execute in real-time.
🔹 Expandable – You can add your own prank commands!

📜 How It Works
ZeroTrace has two parts:
1️⃣ Attacker Script (Termux/Linux) – Sends prank commands to the target.
2️⃣ Victim Script (Windows) – Listens for commands and executes them.

When the attacker sends a command, the victim’s laptop immediately obeys, creating chaos. 😈
